<p><span class='brightwhite'>WHY CYNOSURE?</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cynosure's VT100 emulator is the fastest ever written for OpenComputers, beating OpenOS's VT100 emulation in both performance and compatibility.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cynosure features a nearly complete reimplementation of the Lua standard library, allowing you to get off the ground faster.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cynosure wraps the <span class='code'> load() </span> function to allow full pre-emptive multitasking.</p>
<p><span class='brightwhite'>SOURCE CODE</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynosure's source code is located at <a href='https://github.com/ocawesome101/oc-cynosure'>https://github.com/ocawesome101/oc-cynosure</a>.</p>
