<p>Cynosure is a versatile, pre-emptively multitasked kernel for OpenComputers and the core of <a href='../index.html'>ULOS</a>.</p>
<p><span class='brightwhite'>WHY CYNOSURE?</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cynosure's VT100 emulator is the fastest ever written for OpenComputers, beating OpenOS's VT100 emulation in both performance and compatibility.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A nearly complete reimplementation of the Lua standard library (minus io.popen and io.tmpfile), getting you off the ground faster and better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cynosure wraps the <span class='code'>load()</span> function to allow partial pre-emptive multitasking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Full multi-user support&nbsp;&nbsp;complete with granular permissions for component access, filesystem mounts, user management, and more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Transparent support for multiple network protocols through the <span class='code'>network</span> API; pass in a URL and the rest is done for you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Robust filesystem API built from the ground up for speed and simplicity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- First-class support for custom partition tables and filesystems on unmanaged drives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Support for multiple TTYs on the same computer (one per GPU/screen combo)</p>
