%{Cynosure is a versatile, pre-emptively multitasked kernel for OpenComputers and the core of @ULOS{../index.html}.}
%{*brightwhite{WHY CYNOSURE?}
    - Cynosure's VT100 emulator is the fastest ever written for OpenComputers, beating OpenOS's VT100 emulation in both performance and compatibility.
    - A nearly complete reimplementation of the Lua standard library (minus io.popen and io.tmpfile), getting you off the ground faster and better.
    - Cynosure wraps the *code{load()} function to allow partial pre-emptive multitasking.
    - Full multi-user support  complete with granular permissions for component access, filesystem mounts, user management, and more.
    - Transparent support for multiple network protocols through the *code{network} API; pass in a URL and the rest is done for you.
    - Robust filesystem API built from the ground up for speed and simplicity.
    - First-class support for custom partition tables and filesystems on unmanaged drives.
    - Support for multiple TTYs on the same computer (one per GPU/screen combo)}
